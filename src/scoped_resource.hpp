/**
* A class template, scoped_resource, designed to
* implement the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) approach
* to resource management. scoped_resource is designed to be used when
* a resource is initialized at the beginning or middle of a scope,
* and released at the end of the scope. The template argument
* ReleasePolicy is a functor which takes an argument of the
* type of the resource, and releases it.
*
* Usage example, for working with files:
*
* @code
* struct close_file { void operator()(int fd) const {close(fd);} };
* ...
* {
*    const scoped_resource<int,close_file> file(open("file.txt",O_RDONLY));
*    read(file, buf, 1000);
* } // file is automatically closed here
* @endcode
*
* Note that scoped_resource has an explicit constructor, and prohibits
* copy-construction, and thus the initialization syntax, rather than
* the assignment syntax must be used when initializing.
*
* i.e. using scoped_resource<int,close_file> file = open("file.txt",O_RDONLY);
* in the above example is illegal.
