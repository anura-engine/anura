Anura is the tech behind the spectacular [Frogatto & Friends](https://github.com/frogatto/frogatto/wiki). It is a fully-featured game engine, free for commercial and non-commercial use.

Note: For historic reasons – unlike most projects – Anura's main development branch is `trunk` as opposed to `master`. For example, to clone the repository, you might run `git clone --branch trunk git@github.com:anura-engine/anura.git`.
