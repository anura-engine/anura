Prerequisites:

You need a  relatively recent compiler, because of the use of C++11
features in the engine. The minimum
required version of GCC is 4.8. Versions of clang post 3.1 should work as well. There are build
files for MSVC (requires 2019 desktop edition) for windows and Xcode (requires 4.6 or later).

Please see https://github.com/anura-engine/anura/wiki/Building-On-Windows for Windows builds.

You'll need to have these libraries with equivalent development versions to
build the Anura engine:

 1.50.0 <= boost_iostreams     <= 1.74.0
 1.50.0 <= boost_filesystem    <= 1.74.0
 1.50.0 <= boost_regex         <= 1.74.0
 1.50.0 <= boost_asio          <= 1.74.0
 1.50.0 <= boost_system        <= 1.74.0
 1.50.0 <= libboost-locale-dev <= 1.74.0
 libsdl >= 2.0.0
 libsdl-image >= 2.0.0 (with png support)
 libsdl-mixer >= 2.0.0 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-ttf >= 2.0.12
 gl
 glew
 glm
 libz
 imgui (available as a git submodule)
 icu-i18n

Building:

It is recommended to install the program 'ccache' as this can considerably
speed up build times for subsequent builds. This is however not required.
To build, type 'make'. The Makefile will probably work. :) If it doesn't you
may have to tweak it for your platform. The executable 'anura' will be
created which you can run.

To access the level editor, press CTRL-E during the game.

Have fun!


Building on Ubuntu 19.10 or recent Debian
-----------------------------------------

The following are some specific instructions for setting up the
prequisites for anura on Ubuntu and Debian.

First, install the dependancies.

 sudo apt install build-essential ccache git libboost-dev \
      libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-iostreams-dev \
      libboost-regex-dev libboost-locale-dev libsdl2-image-dev\
      libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libglew-dev libpng-dev\
      libcairo2-dev libfreetype6-dev libvorbis-dev libglm-dev

Then, build the project.

  cd anura #(or wherever you downloaded Anura to)
  git submodule init #(first time only)
  git submodule update
  make -j$(nproc)


Building on Arch
----------------
cd anura #(or wherever you cloned it to)
git submodule init #(first time only)
git submodule update
sudo pacman -S boost boost-libs sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf glew glm glibc glibmm
make -j$(nproc)

Building on Fedora 27
---------------------

sudo dnf install boost-devel boost-iostreams boost-filesystem boost-regex boost-system SDL2 SDL2-devel SDL2_image-devel SDL2_mixer-devel SDL2_ttf-devel SDL2_image SDL2_mixer SDL2_ttf libvorbis-devel gcc glew icu glm


Running 'Frogatto'
==================
To run 'Frogatto' check out the frogatto repository into
modules/frogatto4 then run anura
