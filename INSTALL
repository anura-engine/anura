Prerequisites:

You need a recent compiler, because of the use of C++11 features in the engine. The minimum
required version of GCC is 4.8. Versions of clang post 3.1 should work as well. There are build
files for MSVC (requires 2019 desktop edition) for windows and Xcode (requires 4.6 or later).

Please see https://github.com/anura-engine/anura/wiki/Building-On-Windows for Windows builds.

You'll need to have these libraries with equivalent development versions to
build the Anura engine:

 1.50.0 <= boost_iostreams  <= 1.73.0
 1.50.0 <= boost_filesystem <= 1.73.0
 1.50.0 <= boost_regex      <= 1.73.0
 1.50.0 <= boost_asio       <= 1.73.0
 1.50.0 <= boost_system     <= 1.73.0
 libsdl >= 2.0.0
 libsdl-image >= 2.0.0 (with png support)
 libsdl-mixer >= 2.0.0 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-ttf >= 2.0.12
 gl
 glew
 libz
 imgui (available as a git submodule)
 icu-i18n

Building:

It is recommended to install the program 'ccache' as this can considerably
speed up build times for subsequent builds. This is however not required.
To build, type 'make'. The Makefile will probably work. :) If it doesn't you
may have to tweak it for your platform. The executable 'anura' will be
created which you can run.

To access the level editor, press CTRL-E during the game.

Have fun!


Building on Ubuntu 19.10
------------------------

The following are some specific instructions for setting up the prequisites for anura on Ubuntu.

First, install the dependancies.
sudo apt install build-essential ccache git libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-iostreams-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-locale-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libglew-dev libpng-dev libcairo2-dev libfreetype6-dev libvorbis-dev

Then, build the project.
cd anura #(or wherever you downloaded Anura to)
make -j$(nproc)
