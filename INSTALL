Prerequisites:

You need a recent compiler, because of the use of C++11 features in the engine. The minimum 
required version of GCC is 4.8. Versions of clang post 3.1 should work as well. There are build
files for MSVC (requires 2013 desktop edition) for windows and Xcode (requires 4.6 or later).

You'll need to have these libraries with equivalent development versions to 
build the Anura engine:

 boost_iostreams >= 1.50.0
 boost_filesystem >= 1.50.0
 boost_regex >= 1.50.0
 boost_asio >= 1.50.0
 boost_system >= 1.50.0
 libsdl >= 2.0.0
 libsdl-image >= 2.0.0 (with png support)
 libsdl-mixer >= 2.0.0 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-ttf >= 2.0.12
 gl
 glew
 libz
 
Building:

It is recommended to install the program 'ccache' as this can considerably
speed up build times for subsequent builds. This is however not required.
To build, type 'make'. The Makefile will probably work. :) If it doesn't you 
may have to tweak it for your platform. The executable 'anura' will be 
created which you can run.

To access the level editor, press CTRL-E during the game.

Have fun!


Building on Ubuntu 13.10
------------------------

The following are some specific instructions for setting up the prequisites for anura on Ubuntu 13.10

sudo apt-get install build-essential ccache git libboost1.53-all-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libfreetype6-dev mercurial autoconf libglew-dev libpng12-dev liblua5.2-dev
hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_ttf
cd SDL_ttf
hg update "release-2.0.12"
./autogen.sh
mkdir build && cd build
../configure && make && sudo make install


Building on Debian Wheezy
-------------------------

The following are some specific instructions for setting up the pre
requirements for Anura on Debian Wheezy.

Boost 1.57.0 can be troublesome, but 1.56.0 seems to build more stable.
Moreover the developers are building against 1.56.0 as of Apr 2015. You will
have to download Boost 1.5X.X from http://www.boost.org/ because the Debian
.deb repos hold Boost 1.49.0.
Personally, I have not tested 1.58.0 yet, but testing with 1.57.0 led me to a
lot of trouble.

Extract Boost and run:

    $ ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=iostreams,filesystem,regex,system
    $ su -c './b2 install'
    $ _

Or:

    $ ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=iostreams,filesystem,regex,system
    $ su
    # ./b2 install
    # exit
    $ _

Or maybe you prefer:

    $ export UNPRIVILEGED_USER=$USER
    $ su
    # sudo -u $UNPRIVILEGED_USER ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=...
    # ./b2 install
    # exit
    $ _

If you ever need to reinstall Boost after installing from sources, you might
find useful this command, because `b2` does not provide 'uninstall'
capabilities.

    # rm -rf /usr/local/lib/libboost_* /usr/local/include/boost/

If there is any problem for building libbost_iostreams, as Boost documentation
states, check if you already configured the development packages for libz and
bzip2. In Debian Wheezy .deb repos, these are `zlib1g-dev` and `libbz2-dev`.

You will also have to compile SDL2 yourself. It follows the standard build
procedures of projects using GNU Autotools enhanced with autogen.sh. As an
example, type these commands with your mileage variations, they are a lot of
commands, but the process is often very stable, constant and straightforward:

    $ wget http://libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.3.tar.gz
    $ tar xf SDL2-2.0.3.tar.gz && pushd SDL2-2.0.3/
    $ sh autogen.sh
    $ mkdir build/ && pushd build/
    $ ../configure && make && su -c 'make install' && popd && popd
    $ wget http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL2_mixer-2.0.0.tar.gz
    $ tar xf SDL2_mixer-2.0.0.tar.gz && pushd SDL2_mixer-2.0.0/
    $ sh autogen.sh
    $ mkdir build/ && pushd build/
    $ ../configure && make && su -c 'make install' && popd && popd
    $ wget http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/SDL2_image-2.0.0.tar.gz
    $ tar xf SDL2_image-2.0.0.tar.gz && pushd SDL2_image-2.0.0/
    $ sh autogen.sh
    $ mkdir build/ && pushd build/
    $ ../configure && make && su -c 'make install' && popd && popd
    $ wget http://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL2_ttf-2.0.12.tar.gz
    $ tar xf SDL2_ttf-2.0.12.tar.gz && pushd SDL2_ttf-2.0.12/
    $ sh autogen.sh
    $ mkdir build/ && pushd build/
    $ ../configure && make && su -c 'make install' && popd && popd

Finally make sure you have got these software and libraries through Debian's
package management:

* ccache (recommended)
* libcairo2-dev
* libglew-dev
* libglw1-mesa-dev (probably required)
* libsdl-gfx1.2-dev

At this point you might be able to run `make` in Anura's source folder. That
would create the `anura` executable in the Anura sources directory. If you got
a linker error instead of a successful build, it is most probably because Anura
deprecated GCC 4.7 to be able to use C++11 features. There is no GCC > 4.7.2 in
the Wheezy .deb repos, still you can advance downloading, building and
installing GCC from sources 4.8.X, e.g. 4.8.4. It will cost you >5GiB of disk
usage after a successful build, if you go the lazy way and do not specify which
front-ends to compile, that builds all the available fronts.

The GCC documentation for configuration, building, installing and testing is
daunting, but the process, though uncommon because it's weird to know when it
built correctly until installation time, even running the tests suite, is
relatively straightforward. If you did not specify a PREFIX when configuring,
at the end of the process you should have a `/usr/local/bin/g++` that depending
on your $PATH value it might or might not override the default `/usr/bin/g++`.
You might check using `/usr/local/bin/g++ --version` or
`/usr/bin/g++ --version`.

However, if you did this and compiled Anura with a custom GCC built and
installed from sources, living in `/usr/local/`, if you try to run it, you most
probably will have a GLIBC error during process creation. This is because you
have to make sure you run Anura with a runtime environment (glibc, the GNU
implementation of the C standard library) friendly to GCC 4.8.4. And very
possibly, you might want this to apply ONLY to Anura.

So, you could find reasonable to `find` libstdc++.so (which is a symlink) and
wipe it recreating it repointing to a newly created libstdc++.so.X.X.X
residing anywhere under /usr/local/. This should make Anura work, but you might
find safer not to do more changes to /usr/ instead rather using the environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH when running Anura.

So instead just calling the command `ANURA_DIR/anura`, you can call:

    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib32/ ANURA_DIR/anura

or:

    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/ ANURA_DIR/anura

Assuming a Debian multiarch environment after configuring the package
`multiarch-support`, or a similar LD_LIBRARY_PATH value if not. For GCC 4.8.4
corresponds libstdc++.so.6.0.19, that is the library version that you would
want to find under /usr/local/.

Finally, running Anura at this point should tell you that it cannot find the
frogatto module. Telling that would mean everything worked OK.

Build was successful, you could continue now, f.i., downloading Frogatto to
ANURA_DIR/modules/frogatto, if you just want to run Frogatto.
